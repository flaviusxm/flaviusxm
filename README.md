## About me 

Hey there! My name is Flavius 👨‍💻, a dedicated student with a strong passion for WebApps Engineering and AI 🌐. I'm currently in my final year at the Faculty of Cybernetics, Statistics and Computer Science, specializing in Economic Informatics. I truly believe in the power of technology to make a positive impact, which is why I actively seek opportunities to help underserved communities and empower individuals through coding.

I’m driven by the idea of transforming concepts into reality by leveraging programming to create practical, meaningful solutions. I primarily work with languages like Python 🐍, JavaScript 💡, Java ☕, C 💻, and C++ ⚙️, using them to build innovative applications that solve real-world problems. Whether it’s through mentoring or developing software, I’m committed to making a difference.
